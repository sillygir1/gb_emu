# Gameboy Emulator.

WIP. Still in early stages of development and can't emulate anything yet.

Building:

- `make`
- `make debug` if any functionality from `tests.c` is used

Usage:

- `./out/binary path/to/rom` - load rom
- `./out/binary -m path/to/memory/dump` - load memory dump (for development purposes)
